# Title

Project description goes here. This description is usually two to three lines long. It should give an overview of what the project is, eg technology used, philosophy of existence, what problem it is trying to solve, etc. If you need to write more than 3 lines of description, create subsections.

> ** NOTICE: ** put here a message that is very relevant to users of the project, if any.

## Features

Here you can place screenshots of the project. Also describe your features using a list:

* Easy integration;
* Few dependencies;
* Beautiful template-english with a nice `README`;
* Great documentation and testing?

## Getting started

### 1. First step to get started

Usually the first step to get started is to install dependencies to run the project. Run:

```
apt get install dependency
```

It is recommended to place each command on a different line:

```
apt get install something else
```

This way users can copy and paste without reading the documentation (which is what usually happens).

### 2. Other step(s)

Usually the next steps teach you how to install and configure the project for use / development. Run:

```
git clone https://github.com/ccuffs/template-english template-english
```
